#Numeric Data Type
a = 100
print("The type of variable having value", a, " is ",type(a))

b = 10.2435
print("The type of variable having value", b, " is ",type(b))

c = 100+3j
print("The type of variable having value", c, " is ",type(c))


#String Data Type
a = "String in a double quote"
b = "String in a single qoute"
print(a)
print(b)

print(a,"concatenated with",b)
print(a+" concated with "+b)


#Python List Data Type
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(a)

b = ["hello", "johnn", "reese"]
print(b)

c = ["hey", "you", 1,2,3, "go"]
print(c)

print(c[1:6])
print(c[:])


#Python Tuple
    #The tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to a list. 
    # But it is immutable. That means data in a tuple is write-protected. 
    # Data in a tuple is written using parenthesis and commas.
a = (1,2,3,)
print(a)

b = ("hello", 1,2,3, "go")
print(b)

print(b[4])


#Python Dictionary
    #Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form. 
    # It is similar to the hash table type. Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form key:value. 
    # It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.

#a sample dictionary variable
a = {1:"first name", 2:"last name", "age":33}

#print value having key=1
print(a[1])

#print value having key=2
print(a[2])

#print value having key="age"
print(a["age"])
