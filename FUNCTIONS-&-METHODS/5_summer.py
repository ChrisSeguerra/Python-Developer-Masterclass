# What we have learned: functions...
# 1. Take INPUT and transform it into OUTPUT
# 2. Allow us to REUSE the same block of code in many PLACES

# Some FUNCTIONS are in built in Python that allows as to be USE
# and DON'T need to manually do functions on are own.

# Examples:
print() 
print(len("MIMI"))
print(len(["cat", "mimi", "dondon"]))
print(sum([1, 4, 2, 7, 5,]))
